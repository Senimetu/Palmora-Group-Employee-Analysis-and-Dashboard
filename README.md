📌OVER VIEW OF THE CASE STUDY

The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues
bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently
published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This
doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the
business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards,
revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues.


🎯 **Objective**

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Palmoria Grouo data and generate actionable insights using PowerBI tools such as tables, functions, charts, and dashboards to generate the required variables.

🧾 **Dataset Description**

The dataset contains information from Amazon product site:

Name, Gender, Department, Salary, Regions, Rating, Dept-Rating, Bonus Rating, Annual Bonus, Total Pay, Salary Band.


Size: 946 rows × 11 columns

🔍 **Analysis Objectives**

1. The gender distribution in the organization with consideration of the regions and
departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of
management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay
employees a minimum of $90,000
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,
etc.?
● Also visualize this by regions
